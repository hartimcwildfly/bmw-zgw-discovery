This console application scans all attached networks (excluding non IPv4, non loopback ones) for BMW ZGWs (central gateways).
It's a replacement for the proprietary ZGW_SEARCH.exe.
It's built with .NET 6 so it can be run on any platform.

The executables are generated by each github pipeline run. (e.g. https://github.com/hartimcwildfly/bmw-zgw-discovery/actions/runs/3107282428)
